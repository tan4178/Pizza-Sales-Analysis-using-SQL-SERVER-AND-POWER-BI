🍕 Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL-SERVER-AND-POWER-BI

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL Server, Excel, and Power BI to uncover valuable business insights. The analysis identifies revenue trends, ordering patterns, product performance, and customer preferences to support data-driven decision-making.

Using SQL, I performed key calculations such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, order frequency, category contribution, and size-based performance. I also analyzed daily and monthly trends, along with top and bottom performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and order count.

The cleaned dataset was modeled in Power BI to build an interactive dashboard displaying KPIs, visual trends, and performance comparisons. This dashboard allows users to quickly understand business performance and identify opportunities for improvement.
